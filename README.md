** NOT MAINTAINED **

# Imgget
For backing up images from Instagram.

**Intended for personal use and educational use only!**

## What is is
A small console applications.
The application guides you through the process of downloading all images from a given Instagram account.
It requires some manual work, but the download process is automatic. 

Just follow the on-screen instructions. Chrome is recommended as default browser. 

## Notes
This project was made for fun, and to learn something new. 

I use a 500ms delay between each image download, to make sure the server wont shut my connection. 
I don't really know if this is necessary, but past experience tells me so.
There is another delay for each 50 images, again, to prevent server from shutting you down. The delay is 10 seconds. 

I have successfully tested the app by downloading an entire account of pictures (a bit over 1500). No errors. 

I will probably continue development on this. I also have another project in my mind.
